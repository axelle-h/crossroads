    Ugh. What happened last night? 
    
    You can't remember, but your head feels like a pachinko machine shaken one time too many, and everything smells like garbage. Wait, no. That’s just you.
    
    There's a gigantic crow, sitting on the telephone lines above you. You get the distinct feeling it is judging you.
    
    You glare at it. Damn bird doesn't seem to care.
    
    Though the garbage heap is surprisingly comfortable, as piles of trash go, it occurs to you that should probably get a move on -- before you provoke the bird into pecking you to death. 
    
    You sit up with a grunt and crawl out of the pile of garbage bags. 
    
    After a cursory check, you realize you've lost your phone and your wallet. Your suit jacket is long gone, but you have a few crumpled thousand-yen notes in your pant pocket.
    
    What do you want to do now?

    a. Try to figure out where you are. 
    b. There must be someone around. Ask them where you are.
    c. Go... this way. Yep, this way is good.

    You dimly remember going this way last night.

    Hey, isn't that where you threw up last night!? Now you're making progress.
    
    And the izakaya right next to the Family Mart does seem terribly familiar. As in, 'I've just spent half the night drinking there', familiar.
    
    You squint at the small sign above the door. Yamato-san's bar. 
    
    What do you want to do now?

    a. Ask the owner if he has found your phone or your wallet.
    b. Follow the vomit. The vomit will show you the way.

    The izakaya is quiet and dim, and blessedly free of judgmental birds. You blink a few times until your eyes adjust to the darkness.

    "Hello?" you call out softly, but there's no answer.
    
    You wander around for a few minutes, then notice a door has been left half open. It leads into a softly lit room, where a dozen of burly, serious-looking men in suits are sitting around a 
    table, counting piles of crisp yen notes and weighing neat little plastic bags of transparent crystals on a kitchen scale.
    
    It must be your lucky day: you've just walked into a drug deal.

    a. Scream (manfully) and run for your life.

    You decide to follow the trail of vomit. Hey, it's as good an idea as any -- and if the crow disapproves, it keeps its opinion to itself.

    Bleh.
    
    This was a terrible idea.

    You know this place. You've been drinking here for years with your boss. You spent all of last night downing shots here.
    
    "Good morning, Yamato-san," you manage to force out, with a smile you hope doesn't look too manic. "I lost my phone last night. Just wanted to see if you had, err, found it."
    
    Yamato gives you a hard look, and you keep your expression as neutral as you can manage it, very pointedly keeping your eyes away from the burly men, the piles of money and the small bags full of crystals.
    
    After a minute, Yamato's face relaxes a fraction, and he returns your smile.
    
    "As a matter of fact, I did find your phone as well as your wallet." He shakes his head in mild reproof. "You must be more careful in the future."
    
    He's not talking about your alcohol consumption, you realize. Or your lost possessions.
    
    You nod frantically.
    
    Yamato makes his way to you and takes your arm, steering you gently but firmly outside of the backroom. He closes and locks the door after you.
    
    "Stay here," Yamato orders. "Don't touch anything."
    
    Yamato strides to the bar and rummages under it for a few instants before surfacing.
    
    "Here, your phone and your wallet. Now, let's get you a taxi. You will go home, and we will never speak of this again. Clear?"
    
    Some devilish part of you almost replies, 'Crystal' but wisely, you decide to abstain.

    You grab a bottle of water and some rice balls to settle your stomach, and pay for both with some of your remaining cash.
